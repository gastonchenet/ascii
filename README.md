# ASCII Art Generator

This is a simple ASCII art generator that converts images to ASCII art. It uses the C++ 'stb_image.h' library to read images. The ASCII art is generated by converting the image to grayscale and then mapping the grayscale values to ASCII braille characters.

## Usage

The usage is simple. Just run the program and pass the path to the image you want to convert to ASCII art as an argument. For example:

```bash
./ascii_art_generator image.jpg
```

The program will then generate the ASCII art and print it to the console.

### Arguments

- `--help` or `-h`: Show the help message.
- `--size` or `-s`: The width of the output ASCII art. Default is 100.
- `--invert` or `-i`: Invert the colors of the ASCII art. Default is false.
- `--threshold` or `-t`: The threshold for converting grayscale values to ASCII characters (between 0 and 255). Default is 200.
